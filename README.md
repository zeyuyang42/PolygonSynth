# PolygonSynth
This is a simulation of Polygogo Eurorack module. As the manual is not available yet, I am inferencing some features by watching videos. The code is built upon [https://github.com/lukemcraig/PathSynth](https://github.com/lukemcraig/PathSynth) as a starting point.

## Fork notes

No further changes were made to the original PolygonSynth project. I just replaced Projucer with CMake and made some minor changes to include/namespace to make it compile on my machine.
